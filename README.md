# Walmart-TAMU-Datathon-Submission
For participants of the 2020 TAMU Datathon to submit their Walmart challenge.
Walmart is a fortune 1 retail company that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount departments stores and grocery stores, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas. Apart from these Walmart has a big online business with well over 65+ online banners under its name including Walmart.com. Naming a few such as Moosejaw, Bonobos, jet etc.
 
Our project is titled – Product Search Engine. The main area of focus is to provide a customer a consistent user experience when he/she is searching for a product from our website. We achieve that by developing consistent product clusters based on learning rule analysis on Walmart.com but also by overlaying some natural language processing with the use of indexes to get meaningful results when a query is provided.
 
Now let us talk about some of those tasks that need to be completed to successfully complete the hack.
 
Task 1
 
Teams will be responsible for crawling the Walmart.com to assemble a collection of 20,000 products web pages and their Web graph. For this hack we are going to consider at least 9 categories with Food, Electronics, Personal care, Toys and Home as compulsory categories but the team has liberty to choose 4 other categories of their liking.
 
Task 2
 
Teams will be responsible for indexing the crawled web pages and for the link analysis of the Web graph that was retrieved by crawling. Participants shall choose any one of the relevant models of their liking such as the vector space model, probabilistic model, latent semantic or linguistic and knowledge base model. I highly recommend the last model.
 
Task 3
 
Teams shall be responsible for clustering the product web pages that were crawled. Please be sure to provide at least two clustering criteria and use domain evaluation metrics to compare between them. Select one of the clustering criteria to improve the relevance model
 
Task 4
 
Teams will be responsible in enabling queries to be entered and result to be present in a rudimentary graphical user interface embedded in the webpage that host your search engine
When a query is entered, the search engine should present in separate search engine web page frames of the web page the following:
Results of your relevance models against the query – all of those that you have implemented; 	
Results of the search engine relevance against the query when clustering has been incorporated – you should present the clusters that you have obtained as well.
